The task assignment is a optimization algrorithm. The function is given a number of tasks and the time it takes to complete them and k, the number of workers available. 
Each worker can take 2 tasks, no more, no less. The algorithm should minimize the time it takes to complete all the tasks. 
So the work time should be somewhat be equally distributed between the workers.

The function returns the indices of the tasks in pairs. One pair of indices indicates the tasks that are assigned to a specfic worker.

Example:
Input:
k = 3
tasks = [1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4] - the times it takes to complete the individual task, so there are six tasks in total.

Output:

[[0, 2], [4, 5], [1, 3]] - 

tasks[0] + tasks[2] = 6 in some time unit
tasks[4] + tasks[5] = 5 
tasks[1] + tasks[3] = 6
